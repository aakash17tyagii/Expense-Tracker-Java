 # 📊 Expense Tracker - Java Project

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple **Expense Tracker** I built using Java. The project lets you **add income and expenses**, categorize them, view a **monthly summary**, and also **save/load your data from a file**.

## 🎯 Features 
 
✅ **Add Income or Expense** 
- You can enter the **date**, **type** (Income/Expense), **category** (like Food, Rent, Travel, Salary, Business), and **amount**.
   
✅ **Categorize Transactions**
- For **Income**, you can choose **Salary** or **Business**.
- For **Expenses**, you can choose **Food**, **Rent**, or **Travel**. 
 
✅ **Monthly Summary**
- Shows **total income**, **total expense**, and **balance** (Income - Expense) for each month. 

✅ **File Support**
- Load transactions from a file.
- Save all transactions to a file.
